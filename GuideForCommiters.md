# Guidelines #

This page contains guidelines for committers

  * Changes should have unit-tests, and unit-test should be run before committing to verify that the logic is still valid.
  * All commits should have comments in the commit log.
  * All commits should include an update to the CHANGELOG file.
  * Try to limit commits to single tasks, (i.e. commit each bug fix seperately)
